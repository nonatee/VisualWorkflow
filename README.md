Node based modular and extendible app for rust. Helped me learn about object safety.


How to use:
To use, draw connectors from nodes by clicking and holding right click.
Types of nodes:
The green node starts the flow.
The white one with the textbox will forward whatever is written.
The blue node will jumble the string.
The yellow one will uppercase the string.
